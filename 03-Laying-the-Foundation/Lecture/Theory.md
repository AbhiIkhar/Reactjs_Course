0. Parcel is like a Manager of babel.

1. It is industry standard to run any command we put that commands in script.
   ex: script{
   "start":"parcel index.html"
   "build":"pacrel build index.html"
   }
   npm start === npm run start
   npm build !== npm run build

2. Jsx is not valid javascript it can not be understand JS Engine because JS Engine
   understand ES6 + all versions

If JS engine can't understand this code then how JS Engine able to run it ?
--> This JSX code get transpiled-(converted into browser understandable code) by Parcel with
help of babel.

How babel-[it is library not created by facebook] is doing this ?
--> Takes jsx and convert into js

How the above code is working ?
--> JSX => React.createElement => JS object => HTMLElement with help of render

## Note : Babel is js compiler ==> It is just piece of software.

## Different Ways to render Functional Component

<!--

## Power of jsx :

--> If above "data" is malicious api call which can take your cookies information
then u don't need to worry jsx take care of such cross site scripting attack

## DONE

- Find various tags in jsx :

1. JSX turn into js and its attribute convert into its keys.
2. JavaScript has limitations on variable names. For example, their names canâ€™t contain dashes or be reserved words like class.
3. That's why in React, many HTML and SVG attributes are written in camelCase.
   ex: class ==> className ,stroke-width ==> strokeWidth
